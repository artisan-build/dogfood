# Introduction

> Introduction to the Laravel Forge API.

<Warning>
  This documentation is for the new Laravel Forge API. For the legacy API, please refer to the [legacy API documentation](https://forge.laravel.com/api-documentation).
</Warning>

The Laravel Forge API allows you to programmatically interact with your Laravel Forge account and manage your organizations, servers, sites, and other resources.

## Base URL

The base URL for the Laravel Forge API is:

```
https://forge.laravel.com/api
```

## Authentication

The Laravel Forge API uses token-based authentication. You can generate an API token from your [Laravel Forge account settings](https://forge.laravel.com/profile/api). Once you have your token, include it in the `Authorization` header of your API requests as follows:

```http  theme={null}
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

## Headers

All API requests must include the following headers:

```http  theme={null}
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
```

## Errors

The Laravel Forge API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. Common status codes include:

| Status Code | Description                       |
| ----------: | :-------------------------------- |
|       `200` | Success                           |
