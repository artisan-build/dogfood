# About This Project

This project is a monorepo that contains all of the packages that make up our SaaS starter kit. It is a Laravel
application that requires all of our packages and contains demos of many of them. Each subdirectory of the packages
directory is a stand-alone PHP package, hosted on GitHub (we use Git Subtree Split to keep them up to date with our
work here).

When working on a feature within this project, make sure that you are working in the most appropriate directory within
the packages/ directory unless you are building out demo material within the app itself.

When doing any work within a subdirectory of packages, if you reference any classes or components within another
subdirectory of packages, make sure that the composer.json of the package you are working on requires the package on
which you are depending.

We are trying to keep each package as narrowly focused as possible. Here are some important guidelines:

1. Do not duplicate functionality between packages. If functionality that you require exists in another package, use it
and make sure that the package you are working on is set up to require the package that contains the functionality.

2. When there might be multiple implementations of something (such as using different third party providers), the
package should simply provide contracts. Each implementation should live within its own package that contains everything
required to fulfill all of those contracts.

Do not work beyond the scope of any request. Keep your changes small. We prefer to iterate with small changes over
making large sweeping changes.

# Lessons Learned

When using Verbs events:
- Don't instantiate events and build them up manually (don't use `new Event()` and set properties)
- Instead, use static methods `fire()` or `commit()` directly on the event class with named arguments
- Use `commit()` when you need the result back from the event's handle method
- Use `Verbs::commitImmediately()` in tests to ensure events are processed immediately
- Name event classes in the past tense to indicate they represent something that has happened (e.g., `EmailVerificationNotificationSent` instead of `SendEmailVerificationNotification`)

Code Style and Architecture:
- Prefer direct actions over Laravel's event system. Instead of dispatching Laravel events that are handled by listeners, perform the actions directly in Verbs events. This makes the code more explicit and easier to follow.
- Example: Instead of `event(new Registered($user))` which triggers a listener to send a verification email, directly call `$user->notify(new VerifyEmail)` in the Verbs event.
