# Kibble by Artisan Build

This is our package management application. It allows us to develop and update all of our packages in a single
location. If you are contributing to one of our packages, you'll do so by cloning this repository and using our tooling
to create your pull request. It's a little bit different to the usual open-source workflow, but once you try it we think
you will like it.

## Required Dependencies

In order to use Kibble to contribute to our open-source packages, you must have a license for Flux UI. We're huge
fans of Livewire, Flux, and Caleb and we've gone all-in on using Flux wherever it makes sense. Because several of our
packages here require it, you won't be able to run `composer install` without an auth.json containing credentials for
it.



## Using Kibble Yourself

TODO: Write up documentation for how to use Kibble as a package manager.
