# Artisan Build's Dog Food

This is our package management application. It allows us to develop and update all of our packages in a single
location. If you are contributing to one of our packages, you'll do so by cloning this repository and using our tooling
to create your pull request. It's a little bit different to the usual open-source workflow, but once you try it we think
you will like it.

## Required Dependencies

In order to contribute to our open-source packages, you must have a license for Flux UI. We're huge
fans of Livewire, Flux, and Caleb and we've gone all-in on using Flux wherever it makes sense. Because several of our
packages here require it, you won't be able to run `composer install` without an auth.json containing credentials for
it.

## How to Contribute

We recommend using [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) to contribute to this project. It's a modern fork of VSCode that is
fully compatible with your existing extensions. We've spent a great deal of time customizing the AI instructions to make
it easier to work with our codebase, and to make the suggestions more accurately in line with our own coding standards.

## Want to Use This to Manage Your Own Packages?

This is just a bare-bones Laravel installation. The only thing we've built into this application itself is some demos
for our packages. So there's nothing stopping you from using this tooling to manage your own suite of open-source PHP
packages.
